 Full Stack Open â€“ Part 0 Exercises (0.1â€“0.6)

 0.1: What happens when you open a web page?

1. The browser looks up the domain name using DNS to find the server's IP.
2. It sends an HTTP GET request to the server.
3. The server responds with an HTML file.
4. The browser reads the HTML and requests additional files (CSS, JS, images).
5. It then renders the page for the user.

 0.2: Web Developer's Work

Web developers:
- Write HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and often backend code too)
- Use tools like VS Code, Git, and GitHub
- Use the browserâ€™s DevTools to debug
- Often work with frameworks like React or backend tools like Node.js
- Build and maintain interactive web applications
